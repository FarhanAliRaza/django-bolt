Must Have (Blockers):
✅ Core API functionality - DONE
✅ Authentication - DONE (JWT complete)
✅ Tests passing - DONE (142 passed)
✅ Better error messages - DONE (Enhanced exception system with structured errors)
✅ Health check endpoints - DONE (/health, /ready with custom checks)
✅ Request/Response logging - DONE (Integrates with Django's logging)
❌ PyPI package - Missing (currently manual install)

Should Have (Important):
✅ Error handling with Django DEBUG integration - DONE
✅ Structured error responses (FastAPI-compatible) - DONE
✅ Response compression
✅ OpenAPI/Swagger docs - implemented (Some parts remaining like grouping and stuff)
✅ Django admin integration
✅ Static file serving

⚠️ API Key auth - Partial (only in-memory)
⚠️ Testing utilities - (Partially there)

✅ HEAD AND OPTIONS methods - DONE
  - HEAD requests properly strip response body (RFC 7231 compliant)
  - OPTIONS requests with automatic method discovery and Allow header
  - Support for custom OPTIONS handlers via Response class
  - CORS preflight compatible

❌ Class based views - Not implemented
guards should be funcional and should have a way to implement in python
Nice to Have (Can defer):
Pagination helpers

## Recent Improvements (Error Handling & Logging)

### Error Handling System ✅

- **Enhanced exception hierarchy** (`exceptions.py`)

  - `BoltException` base with specialized HTTP exceptions
  - 4xx errors: BadRequest, Unauthorized, Forbidden, NotFound, etc.
  - 5xx errors: InternalServerError, ServiceUnavailable, etc.
  - Validation errors: RequestValidationError, ResponseValidationError

- **Error handlers** (`error_handlers.py`)

  - FastAPI-compatible validation error format (422 with field locations)
  - Structured JSON error responses
  - Debug mode with tracebacks (respects Django's DEBUG setting)

- **Rust error module** (`src/error.rs`)
  - Proper exception handling in Rust
  - Structured error response building
  - Exception type detection and routing

### Logging System ✅

- **Logging configuration** (`logging/config.py`)

  - Integrates with Django's logging system
  - Uses Django's DEBUG setting for log levels
  - Configurable request/response field logging
  - Header/cookie obfuscation for security

- **Logging middleware** (`logging/middleware.py`)
  - Request/response logging with timing
  - Exception logging with tracebacks
  - Skip logging for health checks
  - Status code-based log levels

### Health Checks ✅

- **Health endpoints** (`health.py`)
  - `/health` - Simple liveness check
  - `/ready` - Readiness check with database connectivity
  - Custom health check support
  - Extensible for Redis, cache, etc.

### Django Integration ✅

- **Reuses Django settings**:
  - DEBUG mode for error verbosity
  - Logging configuration
  - Database connections for health checks
