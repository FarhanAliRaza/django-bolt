"""App under test for recovery from a database connection that died.

``/me`` is the path that failed in production: an async handler behind the
default ``JWTAuthentication`` reads ``request.user``. The lazy load runs
``get_user_sync`` on the bounded ORM pool through ``run_orm_blocking``. The
Django connection it uses is parked on a pool thread between requests. When
the database server closes that connection, the next load must fail once at
most, and the request after it must reconnect.

``/orm-threads`` runs one query on each of ``count`` ORM pool threads, so a
test can park a connection on every thread and see which threads reconnect.

``/seed`` migrates the database of the subprocess and creates the test user,
since server projects start with an unmigrated database. ``SECRET`` and
``USERNAME`` are exported so tests can mint matching tokens.

``/me-inline`` is ``/me`` with no await, so Bolt dispatches it synchronously
on the worker thread.

``/echo`` sends a token through a query and returns what the database sent
back, with the process that served it. Two processes that share a socket read
each other's results, so a token that comes back wrong shows the sharing.

``/stream`` returns a sync streaming body that queries on the thread that
iterates it.

``/orm-threads-both-databases`` is ``/orm-threads`` with one query on the
``other`` alias before the query on ``default``.

``/queued-orm-calls`` queues ``count`` calls on the ORM pool at once and
returns how many connections they opened or checked out of a pool.

``/default-executor-query`` queries through ``sync_to_async`` with
``thread_sensitive=False``, which runs on the default executor of the loop.

``/lose-the-pool`` queries on the worker thread, as ``/me-inline`` does. Then
it makes the return of the connection to its pool fail. With ``fail``, the
call raises too. With ``kill``, the call ends its own database session, so the
connection is unusable. The response names the result or the error of the call.

``/pool-stats`` returns the statistics of the connection pool of ``default``.

``/lose-the-pool-on-an-orm-thread`` queries on an ORM pool thread and makes the
return of its connection fail. The worker gives the connection back when its
queue is empty, so the return fails on the idle path of the worker.

``/stream-and-lose-the-pool`` is ``/stream``, but the return of the connection
of the streaming thread fails when the body ends.

``/autocommit-off-then-fail`` runs a call on the ORM pool that turns autocommit
off, creates a temporary table and raises. Then it returns the state of the
connection that the next call gets.

``lane_api`` is a second API, under ``/lane``, with a Django middleware stack.
Its sync route ``/lane/query`` runs complete on a request lane. A test project
lists both APIs in ``BOLT_API``.
